#### Inspiration
The inspiration behind Liskrise DeFi stemmed from the frustration of unused vouchers and the potential for blockchain to redefine financial transactions. We envisioned a decentralized solution that not only addressed this common problem but also embraced the principles of privacy, interoperability, and scalability on the Lisk Blockchain.

#### What It Does
Liskrise DeFi is a decentralized marketplace facilitating the secure buying, selling, and trading of vouchers. It incorporates a unique bidding system, adding a competitive element to the user experience. The project not only provides a solution for voucher management but showcases the power of blockchain in decentralized finance.

#### How We Built It
The development journey began with a clear purpose—creating a user-friendly platform. We implemented smart contracts using the ERC721 standard, integrating Lisk's privacy features for confidential transactions. The UI/Contract frontend was carefully designed to ensure a seamless and engaging interaction for users.

#### Challenges We Ran Into
Axios network errors during image loading and transitioning from ERC20 to ERC721 presented initial challenges. Testing and debugging the smart contract added complexity, and time constraints were a constant factor. However, these challenges fueled our determination to deliver a robust solution.

#### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Successfully overcoming the hurdles and delivering a functional MVP within the hackathon timeframe is a significant achievement. The integration of privacy features, the implementation of a bidding system, and the overall user experience are accomplishments we take pride in.

#### What We Learned
The development process provided valuable insights into smart contracts, ERC721 standards, and the nuances of the Lisk Blockchain. Learning to navigate challenges, from image loading issues to adapting to a new token standard, enhanced our skills in blockchain development.

#### What's Next for Liskrise
Looking ahead, Liskrise aims to refine and expand its features. We plan to enhance privacy measures, optimize for scalability, and explore further interoperability with other blockchain networks. The journey continues as we strive to make Liskrise a cornerstone in the decentralized finance landscape.

We will provide users to upload their vouchers using "IPFS" in dapp

So, enable trustworthy transactions and agreements to be made between dispersed, anonymous participants without the need for a centralised authority, a legal system, or an external enforcement mechanism. The key advantages of using are:
•Speed, efficiency and accuracy
•Trust and transparency
•Security
•Resource optimisation

Tech Stacks use:
Lisk Blockchain for transactions
Solidity
ReactJS
NextJS
Hardhat
Tailwind CSS
Polygon 
Ethereum
IPFS

Default content:-

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
